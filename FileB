Noncentralized Approach
On one hand where Peer Connect members argue in favor of centralized models, there is a peer member who sheds light on a noncentralized approach preferred in his organization. He shares that their organization realized that DG could not be managed out of the IT department. As a result, they started to identify data stewards that are responsible for the domains where they were recognized as the business process experts. “We look for people that have a high degree of data literacy (typically they are already the go-to people when information is needed about a business process in their area) and work with their leadership to make sure that they are authorized to make decisions regarding data governance and data management for that domain,” the peer adds.
One area where the peer’s organization favors centralization is the data steward council. Here, they come together to agree on areas where they identify overlap, address discrepancies in definitions of terms and share ideas regarding data management. “This council is currently moderated out of the IT department as this was traditionally the place to go for data. Our intention is to transfer this responsibility to the business counterparts so that they are enabled to answer questions regarding the business processes they are responsible for based on data through self-service tools rather than by opening a service ticket to the IT department,” the peer shares. It will help them increase organizational agility and will allow the IT department to focus on how the technology can assist the business counterparts to sustain and improve their business processes.
